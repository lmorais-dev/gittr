# Gittr - Stealthy, minimalistic, fast Git server

Got tired of bloated, centralized, privacy abusing Git services? Gittr is the
solution!

I'm building Gittr so that developers can create communities and form groups
with minimal overhead on any hardware. With simple and direct interface that
even newbies can navigate around without getting lost.

Most important, to make a point, to defend ideals I believe are the most
correct and fair.

Gittr is my take on a more simple, privacy respecting, no bullshit git hosting.
